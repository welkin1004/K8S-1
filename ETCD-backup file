if ur using eks then it will take backup automatic but in selfmade cluster u have to did it manually

export ETCDCTL_API=3

etcdctl snapshot save --endpoints=127.0.0.1:2379 \
--cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.cert \
--cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
--key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
/home/ubuntu/myk8scluster.db

etcdctl snapshot restore --data-dir=/var/lib/etcd-new-data /
home/ubuntu/myk8scluster.db

================================================================
we have to backup all the TLS certificates, keys, which associated with cluster components
secondly we have to backup subsequently & restore etcd server of the system 

1] where all the certificates 
/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/        --in this folder all certificates are present

mkdir backup-certs
cp -r /etc/kubernetes/pki backup-certs     --the entire diectory is copied 


Now we have to create a snapshot of etcd server 
for that we have to install etcd control server 
go get github.com/coreos/etcd/etcdctl

then check etdctl command is working type---  etcdctl

for saving snapshot use etcd api 

ETCDCTL_API=3 \
etcdctl snapshot save backup-certs/snapshot.db \
--endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
--cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.cert \
--cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.crt \
--key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.key

after that snapshot is get save

kubeadm reset -f      --the whole cluster get reset 

now restore all certificates 
cp -r backup-certs/pki /etc/kubernetes/

Now restore etcdctl server  

ETCDCTL_API=3 \
etcdctl snapshot restore backup-etcd/snapshot.db  

when we restore it restore in specific path in directory
ls default.etcd/member

we have to copy that directory or move it inside that the member dir 
mv default.etcd/member /var/lib/etcd/

Now finally initialise the cluster by kubeadm init command 

kubeadm init --ignore-preflight-errors=DirAvailable--var-lib-etcd         --that means while cluster is get initialize it should ignore data for etcd server & should take that from that dir
